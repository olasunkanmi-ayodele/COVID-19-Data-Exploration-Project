# COVID-19-Data-Exploration-Project
This is a Data Exploratory project aimed at understanding the spread and impact of Covid-19 since 2020. The dataset revealed how the virus has spread geographically and over time.

In this Project I used MS-Excel to to eliminate several irrelevant columns from the dataset then splitted the dataset into two seperate sheets, namely CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations for easy exploration of the dataset and simplier queries.

Next thing I did was to create a database and added the tables. I uploaded the two datasets on the SQL Server Management Studio to start my exploration.

I carried out several queries that provided the death percentage locally and globally with thw use of Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.
